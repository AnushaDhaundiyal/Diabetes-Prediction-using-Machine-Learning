# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

### Abstract
<p align = justify>This a comprehensive overview of the application of machine learning techniques in the prediction of diabetes. Our model explores the application of machine learning techniques for diabetes prediction. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset containing diverse patient information, including demographics, medical history, and lifestyle factors, using various machine learning algorithms to develop predictive models. Through rigorous feature selection and hyperparameter tuning, the aim is to enhance the accuracy and reliability of these models. The findings of this research not only shed light on the potential of machine learning in early diabetes detection but also provide valuable insights into the key factors contributing to diabetes risk. Ultimately, this work contributes to the ongoing efforts to improve diabetes management and prevention strategies, potentially reducing the burden of this chronic disease on individuals and healthcare systems.</p>

### Problem Statement
<p align = justify>The problem at hand is improving diabetes prediction using machine learning. Current methods fall short in accuracy, relying on limited data, while a wealth of patient information remains untapped. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and diverse data sources, we aim to develop more reliable models for early diabetes detection, with the ultimate goal of enhancing preventive care and reducing the global diabetes burden.
